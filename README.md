# 🐍 AutoBait — Intelligent SSH Honeypot


AutoBait is a lightweight LLM-powered honeypot designed to dynamically wake up only when an attack is detected.

It automatically sniffs the network for port scans and brute-force attempts, and only then activates a realistic fake SSH server that:

    - Simulates a real Linux filesystem,
    - Handles real commands internally when possible,
    - Delegates unknown commands to an LLM for realistic bash-style answers,
    - Profiles the attacker behavior,
    - Logs everything neatly for later analysis.

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Smart activation         | SSH honeypot stays **silent** until a scan or attack is detected             |
| 📂 Realistic filesystem      | Common Linux directories and "juicy" files (AWS creds, database dumps)      |
| 🤖 Hybrid CLI responses      | **Known commands** handled by AutoBait • **Unknown ones** invented by LLM   |
| 🔒 Permission simulation    | Correct "Permission denied" behavior without root privileges                |
| 🛡️ Attacker profiling       | Behavioral analysis generated with a Large Language Model (LLM)             |
| 🖥️ Real bash behavior       | No AI artifacts, no code blocks, no apologies — strictly bash-like answers |
